# 🛡️ KISS: Knowledge Integration System Service for ML Attack Detection & Mitigation  

**KISS (Knowledge Integration System Service)** is a **security framework** that integrates **machine learning and intrusion detection** to identify and mitigate both **network and visual attacks** on ML systems. It combines **Snort for network attack detection** and **YOLOv8n for object recognition** to provide a **comprehensive security solution**.  

## 🚀 Features  

- 🔍 **Network Intrusion Detection** – Uses **Snort** to monitor and detect malicious network traffic.  
- 🖼 **Computer Vision-Based Attack Detection** – Employs **YOLOv8n** to identify visual distortions and adversarial attacks.  
- 📊 **ML Model Robustness Analysis** – Evaluates ML system security under adversarial conditions (e.g., **UDP packet loss & Gaussian noise**).  
- 🏎 **Real-Time Threat Mitigation** – Automatically flags potential threats and logs security events.  
- 🔐 **Secure & Scalable Architecture** – Designed to be integrated into larger ML security frameworks.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **Intrusion Detection:** Snort  
- **Machine Learning:** YOLOv8n (Object Detection)  
- **Networking:** hping3, UDP Sockets  
- **Data Analysis:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)  
- **Security Testing:** Simulated UDP packet loss & Gaussian noise
